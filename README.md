Homework 7 Gavin Brimhall and Chris Langan


Task 1 Module 1
A minivan has two sliding doors. Each door can be opened by either a dashboard switch, itâ€™s inside handle, or its outside handle. The inside handles do not work if a child lock switch is activated. In order for the sliding doors to open, the gear shift must be in park, and the master unlock switch must be activated. Simulate a portion of the control software for the vehicle. 

Task 1 Module 2
This second module will import the first module, and it will test it for a few combinations described in a file.
 
 
Task 2
The United States Postal Service encourages companies that send large volumes of mail to use a bar code denoting the zip code. Add up all  the digits in the bar code and choose the check digit to make the sum a multiple of ten. Write a program that asks the user for a zip code and prints the bar code. Have a function to print the didgits, def printDigit(d), and another function to print the bar code, def printBarCode(zipCode).
